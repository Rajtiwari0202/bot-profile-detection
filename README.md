The Bot Profile Detection System is designed to identify AI-generated content, spam, and anomalous user activity on social media platforms. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), anomaly detection models, and machine learning algorithms, while ensuring real-time scalability with Apache Spark or Dask.
Features

✅ AI-Generated Content Detection – Uses BERT, stylometry analysis, and TF-IDF to detect AI-generated text.
✅ Spam Detection – Identifies repetitive or suspicious messages using heuristic rules and ML classifiers.
✅ Anomalous User Activity – Detects unusual patterns using Isolation Forest, LSTMs, and autoencoders.
✅ Real-Time Processing – Supports Apache Spark/Dask for fast, scalable detection.
✅ API Integration – Flask/Django (optional) for real-time bot detection via API.
